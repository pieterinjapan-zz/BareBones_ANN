# BareBones_ANN
A very basic (standard) artificial neural network implemented from scratch.

- The network uses only sigmoid neurons.
- The number of layers, as well as the number 
  of nodes in each layer can be freely adjusted.

Here, 
- sigmoidANN.py contains the functions for training the neural network 
  on a given set of input/output data. 
- basic_ANN.py generates a test dataset for testing the functions if sigmoidANN.py.
